          <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2> 
        </div>
          <p>My previous knowledge of any coding would be none. I had no experience in any HTML, CSS, or Javascript. I was coming in to hopefully gain more knowledge and grow into that field. Eventually I would like to enhance my skills in these three and I feel like it would benefit me a lot.</p>
  <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
  <p>I started from scratch because I wasn't able to find any templates that worked properly without me having to go through ads, or fake websites that make me download random files.</p>
  <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h2>
  <p>The most challenging part of them portfolio was starting my template and not knowing where to start or how to start. I did more readings and was able to finally start and as soon as I started everything started to slowly fall into place.</p>
  <h2>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</h2>
    <p>This class changes my view on Web Development way more. I say this because it feels more technical but it is something that you have to practice to get to understand and properly put everything in. When I started to get the hang of everything it was more easier and definitely changed my view on how websites can be created.</p>
    <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
  <p>I would recommend taking this class, but also to know if you are completely new, that it can be challenging when learning and never be afraid to ask questions! But who doesn't love a challenge!</p>
