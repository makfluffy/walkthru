        <div id="intro"> 
          <p>Growing up I never trusted in my intuition and in myself as a person. It was hard for me to figure out whats good for me and whats not from how selfless I was. It came to my conclusion I've always learned life the hard way each life lesson. The concept of "for your own good" comes from the question how would you want to live your life? As cliche as it sounds, the meaning stands right in front of you everyday. Every choice you make reflects on the type of life you want leaving it to be all 4YOUROWNGOOD. Eventually I want to tell a story and put them on shirts with a graphical meaning.</p>
